Add more jurisdictions
======================

   Make sure to activate the necessary jurisdictions (tax locations) in the *AvaTax* management
   console. Navigate to either Avalara's `sandbox <https://sandbox.admin.avalara.com/>`_ or
   `production <https://admin.avalara.com/>`_ environment. This will depend on which type of account
   was set up above.

   Next, navigate to :menuselection:`Settings --> Where you collect taxes`. Choose between the three
   different tabs depending on the business need. The first tab is :guilabel:`Sales and use tax`
   where tax can be collected for the United States. Click the :guilabel:`+ (plus)` icon to add
   another location where the company collects sales and use tax.

   The second option, is the :guilabel:`VAT / GST` tab where the :guilabel:`+ (plus)` icon can be
   selected to add another country or territory where the company collects VAT/GST.

   Finally, on the far-right is the :guilabel:`Customs Duty` tab, where a country can be added where
   the comppany collects customs duty. Simply click on the :guilabel:`+ (plus)` icon below the tab.
